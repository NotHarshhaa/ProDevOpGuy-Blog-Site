## 📣 Are You New to DevOps??? 📣

#### We keep saying that DevOps is a culture. But what does that mean?

**DevOps** is a set of practices that combines **software development and information-technology operations** which aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

**Here’s How you can do it:**

Since DevOps is more of a cross-functional mode of working, people working under this culture prefer using a DevOps toolset as a toolchain that performs the following functions:

* **Coding** – code development and review, source code management tools, code merging
* **Building** – continuous integration tools, build status
* **Testing** – continuous testing tools that provide quick and timely feedback on business risks
* **Packaging** – artifact repository, application pre-deployment staging
* **Releasing** – change management, release approvals, release automation
* **Configuring** – infrastructure configuration and management, infrastructure as code tools
* **Monitoring** – applications performance monitoring,

Although, in the past few years a lot of **DevOps tools** have come on board that can help you in multitasking. Apart from **Azure DevOps tools and AWS DevOps tools**, we have this best DevOps tools list right here that literally falls under the trends of **2023 - 2024**
